##What is this screen?
Here we have the first of the screens that adds data to the tables. This screen is not to be confused with the Order Stock screen. This form is used to add new stock to the database. 

This will create a new product record in the database, and if the store wants to order more of this stock they can use the `Order Stock` stock screen to do so.

##How do I use it?

1. Type in the full `Product Name` in the first field.
2. Use the `Quantity` spinner to select an amount of the product that you bought.
3. Type in the 13-digit barcode (starting with a `0` and contaning 13 digits in total).
4. Type in the `Supplier Name` from where you bought the product. If you have not yet bought from this supplier, be sure to add the supplier to the database first via the [Add New Supplier](/addsupplier/) form.
5. Enter the product price.
6. Enter the markup %*. This is the % that you want to add to the product when you sell it in your store.
7. Click the `Add To Database` button and wait for the application to add the data to the table. A confirmation dialog will pop up if the values entered are correct or invalid.

The title bar has the same functionality as all the other screens.

\* *Usually between 9- and 13 percent.*
