##What is this screen?
When a manager wants to order stock, he/she can do it from this screen. Upon completing two simple fields in the form, an email will be constructed and sent to the respective suppplier of the product. 

##How do I use it?
When you want to order a product that is already in your database, simply do the following*:

1. Enter the exact product name as it is listed in the database.
2. Enter the quantity you would like to order from the supplier. 
3. Click on the `Place Order` button. The rest of the fields will be auto-completed. 
4. Click on the `Confirm Order` button once all the fields are auto-completed. 
5. Wait while an email is sent to the supplier through the application.
6. A dialog will be displayed that confirms whether or not the email was successfully sent. 

\* *For testing purposes, all supplier emails are made up. If you want to test the `Order Stock` function, make sure to first add a new supplier with a valid email address via the [Add Supplier](/addsupplier/) screen. Then, add a product to the database that belongs to this supplier.* THEN *you can use the order screen with the product you want to order.*
