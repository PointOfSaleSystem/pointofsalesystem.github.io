This screen is used for all administration features of the application. It has 6 main functions: 

1. [Add new stock]
2. [Order stock]
3. [Remove Stock]
4. [Receive delivery]
5. [Print statements]
6. [Add new supplier]

##How do I use it?
The user has to enter a password to access the application. This is done by clicking on the numbers on the right. If the user made a mistake when entering the password, they can click on the back button to clear the field. 


These are not the only functions of this screen. Like all of the other screens, when the user clicks on the logo at the top left corner, it takes you to [source code](https://github.com/iggnoreza/PointOfSaleSystem) of the application. 

Another function that this screen has, like all the other screens, is the ablitiy to access the screen's project notes by clicking on the screen title at the top next to the POS logo.
