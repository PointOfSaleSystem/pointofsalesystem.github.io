##What is this screen?
This screen is where the actual transactions take place. This function, along with the [search](/search/), are the only two functions that are displayed to the customers and to the cashiers - the rest is all done by the manager. 

##How do I use it?
The user can select any of the products in the database from the table to the right, and it will add that product to the left, on the output area. 
   
For demonstration purposes, the password of the application is `0000`. If the password is entered incorrectly, a dialog pane is brought up to display an error message. 

This is not the only function of this screen. Like all of the other screens, when the user clicks on the logo at the top left corner, it takes you to [source code](https://github.com/iggnoreza/PointOfSaleSystem) of the application. 

Another function that this screen has, like all the other screens, is the ablitiy to access the screen's project notes by clicking on the screen title at the top next to the POS logo.
