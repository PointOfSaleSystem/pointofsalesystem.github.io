##What is this screen?
Whenever the cashier or the customer wants to know more details regarding a certain product in the store, the cashier can enter the name or barcode of the product they are searching for. This screen is particularly useful if the user wants to know the price or other similar details of a certain product.  

##How do I use it?
The cashier can enter the `product name` OR the `barcode` of a product, and it displays all the products in the database with matching names/barcodes. 

A nice feature that this search has is that the user can partially search for a product - for instance the user can enter `iso` and the search will return all product names containing the string `iso`.

The cashier can also click the `View All` button to list all of the items in the database along with their name, barcode, price, and quantity left in the store. 

The project notes, source code, back- and quit buttons are available like all the other screens.
