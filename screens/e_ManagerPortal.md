##What is this screen?
This screen is used for all administration features of the application. It has six main functions: 

1. [Add new stock](/addstock/)
2. [Order stock](/orderstock/)
3. [Remove Stock](/removestock/)
4. [Receive delivery](/receivedelivery/)
5. [Print statements](/printstatements/)
6. [Add new supplier](/addsupplier/)

##How do I use it?
It's simple! All you have to do is click on one of the six buttons that will take you to the different management functions. 

This screen itself has little functionality other than to act as a hub for the six functions.

The company logo on the right is clickable and will take you to Spar's [website](http://kwiksparpaulroos.co.za/).
