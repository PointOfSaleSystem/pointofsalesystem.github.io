##What is this screen?
Here we have the `Receive Delivery` screen that lets the manager process incoming deliveries. Once a delivery arrives for an order that was placed via the `Order Stock` screen can be processed with this screen. 

When a delivery arrives, this screen is used to check that all of the products have successfully been delivered to the store.  

##How do I use it?

1. When a delivery arrives at the store, the manager only has to enter the `Order ID` as is seen on the delivery waybill.  
2. The user clicks on the `Receive Delivery` button and the rest of the fields will be auto-completed. 
3. Check that all the products that were ordered have been ordered are delivered. 
4. If the user is happy that the delivery is correct, he/she can click on the `Confirm Delivery` button.

It's that simple! The application now takes the info you entered and sets the `Delivered` field in the database to `True` to indicate that the order has been delivered.
