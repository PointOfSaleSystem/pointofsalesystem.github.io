##What is this screen?
In case of stock that has been stolen and/or has gone missing, the manager can use this form to remove stock from the database. This is an easy way to remove stock from the database with little to no effort.

##How do I use it?
This form is extremely straight forward to use. Simply enter the `Product Name` and the quantity you wish to remove (make sure the quantity is less than is available in the database), and click the `Delete Stock` button. The program will auto-complete the rest of the fields. 

Click the `Permanently Delete` button to remove the stock from the database.  

##Known Bugs
If you prefer to enter the quantity value with the keyboard, be sure to press the `Enter` key on your keyboard after you entered the value. This is a bug with `JSpinners` that only take values after the `Enter` key has been pressed.
