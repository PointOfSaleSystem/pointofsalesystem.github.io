##What is this screen?
Whenever stock is bought from a new supplier, this form has to be used first to add them to the database.

##How do I use it?
The user has to enter the following details in its respective textfields. 

1. `Supplier name`
2. `Contact name`
3. `Email address` - must be a valid email address. `abc@wx.yz.uk`, or `abc@asdf.com`.
4. `Phone number`

The user then has to click on the `Save` button and all the details will be added to the database. The user can then make use of this supplier's name in other screens such as `Order Stock`. 

##Known Bugs
There is no validation being done for the phone number. The email address also only has to be the correct format, but it does not have to be an active address.
